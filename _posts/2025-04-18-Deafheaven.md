Deafheaven's new album, <i>Lonely People With Power</i>, is the album of the year for me.

I played in a "shoegaze" "band" with friends after highschool. It primed me to appreciate a certain attitude to vocals - that they were not all that special in the grand scheme of things, that they had a role to play in a song that undoubtedly goes beyond the conveying of lyrics and leading a melody, and they are not merely supported by a bunch of tertiary instruments who are second fiddle.<i>Sunbather</i> was the first black metal album I'd ever heard. I remember loving it, and being frustrated by the idiotic purism that surrounded that album - from black metal elitists obsessed with their genre's terrible production and the 'authenticity' this is supposed to convey. George Clark's vocals are texturally powerful and align with the band's music perfectly. Sunbather's melodies were sweet and melancholy, and the new album does this even better, and with greater diversity. Its subject matter is exciting and compelling. Until LPWP, my favorite Deafheaven had been <i>New Bermuda</i>. The riffs are incredible, he has the voice of a wildcat. I have probably listened to it many more times than Sunbather at this point. Deafheaven makes music whose purpose is to be art. It is not some sad byproduct of half-hearted disavowed "I could care less what you think" music. They have made great art in LPWP.

If you like metal, you surely have listened to it already. If you want to like metal, it might be a place you can start. I think eventually a person has to get over themselves and enjoy music with harsh vocals. My life is better for it. My life is also better for liking blast beats and playing the riff at the beginning of 'Black Brick' literally every time I pick up a guitar. After all, harsh vocal styles have been around for a long time in subcultural music - longer than most of us have been alive, now. It is a massive umbrella of different styles, probably as internally varied as is what lies outside the umbrella. It is worth the time, and worth it to cultivate the desire, to overcome one's aversion. I listened to Converge's <i>Jane Doe</i> not because I liked it at first, but because everyone I knew did, and I was able to understand even then that this meant I <i>probably should, too</i>. It was the right choice - and I am grateful I made an effort to like it. It paid off, and opened many other avenues of musical and artistic enjoyment for me. In classic dialectical fashion, I came around to clean vocal styles in metal only much later. Now I consider, for example, Pallbearer a beloved and favorite band. Anyway,
