Together with Xiang Huang and Liang Kong at University of Illinois-Springfield, received grant DE-SC0024278 from the Department of Energy to study the relationships between analog models and submodels, and to develop a compiler to transform ODE systems into population protocols. This project involves many undergraduate research opportunities for Drake and UIS students!
