I'm Andrei - welcome to my site. I'm originally from Riga, Latvia and have been in the U.S. for most of my life. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Iowa State University in 2022, and then started teaching at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.

I love my wife, my family, and my friends. I'm grateful to be able to spend my time doing mathematics and teaching the many brilliant and hard-working students I get to meet at Drake. 

I find it easier to connect with people over music than any other thing. My Bandcamp profile is here: https://bandcamp.com/amigunov .
