My sources tell me that tonight is the first night that Des Moines kids get to trick or treat on Halloween rather than on so-called 'beggars' night'. I guess I think trick or treating on some day that isn't Halloween is like drinking coke zero. To want the aesthetic experience without the mischief and minor vandalism strikes me as wrong.

Anyway. Undoubtedly, <i> All Hallows </i> is one of the best AFI records - and it's just an EP! And one of the songs is one of the best Misfits covers ever recorded! However, <i>Fall Children</i> (below) takes the cake.

<i> Sing the Sorrow </i> got me into AFI when I was about 12 years old or so. This band 'changed my life' in a way that happens a lot more when you're that young. Downstream of this are all of my musical preference that persist to this day. The <i>All Hollows</i> EP shored that up, in particular this song. The Halloween vibes of this album are classic, and immaculate. Happy Halloween!
