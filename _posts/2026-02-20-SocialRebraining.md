I only want to share here a segment from this excellent article by Omar Hernandez in the Brooklyn Rail's Field Notes section:

The article is titled [*Social Debraining*](https://brooklynrail.org/2026/02/field-notes/social-debraining/).


>"The difference between the thick collective intelligence cultivated in CERN and the fragmented cognitive hierarchy that sustains Silicon Valley lies in the artifacts around which decisions are cast. CERN centers the rich machine-human environments bound together by quantum physics, whereas Silicon Valley centers money—the thin abstraction behind their power. Deep probing into nature demands transparency and collective pooling of creativity; money for the sake of money turns mass understanding into a cost. Silicon Valley’s black boxes that degrade nature, intelligence, and work are not accidental. They are artifacts designed to feed Mammon, the concentration of wealth, not the inherent properties of the artifacts themselves, whose usefulness, beauty, and sustainability are secondary—if they matter at all.

>When Silicon Valley figures like Andreessen invoke opaque 'market forces' as a sort of intelligence standing above living human thought, they echo an economic arrangement that works precisely by veiling the arbitrariness of power relations that favor them. They resist making the social systems people inhabit intelligible in a way that allows ordinary people to shape it."
